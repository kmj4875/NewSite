            <p>Java, mud, black tea, tar, wake up juice. No matter what we call it, few of us could get by without at least one cup of coffee during our day. But while we all know about the brew’s eye-opening benefits, there’s new evidence to show that an extract from the beans may have fat-fighting potential.

Where it comes from: As the name implies, “green coffee” is simply unroasted seeds—aka beans—from Coffea, the plant that gives us so many of our morning brews. Coffee contains hundreds of compounds, many of which may have healthful benefits.

What it'll do for you: Green coffee bean extract has gained quite a bit of buzz...

         <p>Potential Weight Loss:
According to a study published in March 2006 in “BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine,” daily supplementation of an extract prepared from green coffee beans reduced body fat and body weight in mice, as well as fat composition in the liver. The effect was similar in mice supplemented with isolated chlorogenic acids and caffeine, which suggests that these are the compounds responsible for the effect. Chlorogenic acids found in green coffee can be digested and absorbed by humans, which implies a similar availability as the extract.

        <p>Throughout my career, I’ve seen dozens of “hot” weight-loss supplements come and go, including bitter orange, chromium picolinate, CLA, hoodia, yerba mate, raspberry ketones, and now green coffee bean extract. Each has been touted as an effortless way to shed pounds, by either boosting metabolism, mobilizing body fat, or suppressing appetite. But as a health professional, it’s my job to be skeptical and ask the tough questions, such as does it really work, where’s the proof, and, above all, is it safe?You may have seen green coffee extract at Starbucks, promoted as a natural energy source with no coffee flavor.It was also featured recently on The Dr. Oz Show.

        <h2><a href="https://authoritynutrition.com/green-coffee-bean-extract-review/" target="_blank">Does Green Coffee Bean Extract Work? A Detailed Review</a></h2>
            <p>Losing weight can be incredibly difficult.

For this reason, people have turned to all sorts of supplements in order to make things easier.

Green Coffee Bean Extract is one of them…. it is currently among the world’s most popular weight loss supplements.

As the name implies, this supplement is extracted from green coffee beans.

It contains a substance called Chlorogenic Acid, which is believed to be responsible for the weight loss effects.

Green coffee extract was promoted by Dr. Oz back in 2012. He is an American TV doctor and probably the most famous health “guru” in the world.

I’m a big fan of supplements in general, but I am extra skeptical when it comes to weight loss supplements because they almost never work as advertised.

This article takes a detailed look at Green Coffee Bean Extract… what it is, how it works and what the science has to say about it.
