            <p>Java, mud, black tea, tar, wake up juice. No matter what we call it, few of us could get by without at least one cup of coffee during our day. But while we all know about the brew’s eye-opening benefits, there’s new evidence to show that an extract from the beans may have fat-fighting potential.

Where it comes from: As the name implies, “green coffee” is simply unroasted seeds—aka beans—from Coffea, the plant that gives us so many of our morning brews. Coffee contains hundreds of compounds, many of which may have healthful benefits.

What it'll do for you: Green coffee bean extract has gained quite a bit of buzz recently as a weight-loss supplement. Many websites sell green coffee pills, and a major coffee company has even started selling a beverage spiked with the extract.

        <h2><a href="#" target="_blank">What Are the Benefits of Green Coffee?</a></h2>
         <p>Potential Weight Loss:
According to a study published in March 2006 in “BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine,” daily supplementation of an extract prepared from green coffee beans reduced body fat and body weight in mice, as well as fat composition in the liver. The effect was similar in mice supplemented with isolated chlorogenic acids and caffeine, which suggests that these are the compounds responsible for the effect. Chlorogenic acids found in green coffee can be digested and absorbed by humans, which implies a similar availability as the extract.
