<center><h6><p>Green coffee beans are coffee beans that have not been roasted. Roasting green coffee beans not only changes the color of the coffee beans but also removes a compound called chlorogenic acid. It’s chlorogenic acid that is at the heart of green coffee bean weight loss claims. When supplements contain “green coffee bean extract”, chlorogenic acid is the extract they are referring to. Like many plant chemicals, chlorogenic acid also has antioxidant properties.</p></h6></center>

            <p>Java, mud, black tea, tar, wake up juice. No matter what we call it, few of us could get by without at least one cup of coffee during our day. But while we all know about the brew’s eye-opening benefits, there’s new evidence to show that an extract from the beans may have fat-fighting potential.

Where it comes from: As the name implies, “green coffee” is simply unroasted seeds—aka beans—from Coffea, the plant that gives us so many of our morning brews. Coffee contains hundreds of compounds, many of which may have healthful benefits.

What it'll do for you: Green coffee bean extract has gained quite a bit of buzz...

         <p>Potential Weight Loss:
According to a study published in March 2006 in “BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine,” daily supplementation of an extract prepared from green coffee beans reduced body fat and body weight in mice, as well as fat composition in the liver. The effect was similar in mice supplemented with isolated chlorogenic acids and caffeine, which suggests that these are the compounds responsible for the effect. Chlorogenic acids found in green coffee can be digested and absorbed by humans, which implies a similar availability as the extract.

        <p>Throughout my career, I’ve seen dozens of “hot” weight-loss supplements come and go, including bitter orange, chromium picolinate, CLA, hoodia, yerba mate, raspberry ketones, and now green coffee bean extract. Each has been touted as an effortless way to shed pounds, by either boosting metabolism, mobilizing body fat, or suppressing appetite. But as a health professional, it’s my job to be skeptical and ask the tough questions, such as does it really work, where’s the proof, and, above all, is it safe?You may have seen green coffee extract at Starbucks. promoted as a natural energy source with no coffee flavor.

Home Coffee Roasting provides a simple way to enjoy the aromas and tastes of freshly roasted, super premium, gourmet coffees.
